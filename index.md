          Yargs helps you build interactive command line user experiences, starting with parsing your arguments, and ending with generating an elegant UI for your CLI application.
          Yargs is a command line argument parsing library. It helps you define options, arguments, and commands you want to accept in your application. As you build out your application, you are able to access the arguments from the object yargs created for you.
